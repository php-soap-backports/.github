# About php-soap-backports

We aim to make code of [php-soap](https://github.com/php-soap/) compatible with PHP 7.1.

We are very grateful to the php-soap project for their work. It is a very handy tool!

Many developers for various reasons are still using below PHP 8. 
This makes it impossible to use wonderful libraries like [php-soap/engine](https://github.com/php-soap/engine) and [php-soap/ext-soap-engine](https://github.com/php-soap/ext-soap-engine) in projects. We try to solve this problem by backporting code to PHP 7.1.
