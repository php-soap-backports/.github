## Branching strategy

- __Always__ base your changes on the `master` branch (all new development happens here),
- When you create Pull Request, always select `master` branch as target, otherwise it
  will be closed (this is selected by default).

> **Note**
> The `main` branch is used to merge changes from the main project

## Coverage

- All written code should be covered by automated tests.
- All written code should be statically analysed.
